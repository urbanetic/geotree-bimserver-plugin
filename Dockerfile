# TODO(orlade): Replace download with JAR built by Maven from added source code.
ADD https://github.com/urbanetic/geotree-bimserver-plugin/releases/download/0.1.0/geotree-bimserver-plugin-0.1.0.jar $BIMSERVER_APP/WEB-INF/plugins/geotree-bimserver-plugin.jar

# Start the BIMserver process and send a request to perform the initial admin setup.
# Admin username is "admin@bimserver.org", and password is "admin".
# TODO(orlade): Do this more directly by writing to database.
# The 30 second sleep is required, since starting Tomcat synchronously doesn't yield once started.
